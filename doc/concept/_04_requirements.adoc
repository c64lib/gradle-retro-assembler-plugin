= Requirements

== System Requirements

=== Java Runtime

The Build Tool requires Java 11 or higher to run.
It is compatible with all operating systems that support Java (Windows, macOS, Linux).

== External Dependencies

Gradle Retro Assembler Plugin depends on several external native tools that must be installed and available on the system `PATH`.
These tools are used by various processors to perform specialized tasks.

=== Required for Assembly

==== KickAssembler

KickAssembler is the primary assembler dialect supported by the plugin.
It must be downloaded and installed.
The plugin can automatically download and manage KickAssembler versions.

Version:: 5.25 or higher (recommended)
Installation:: Automatic via plugin (recommended) or manual download from https://www.kickassembler.com/

=== Optional for Processors

The following tools are only required if you use the corresponding processors:

==== VICE Emulator

Required for running KickAssembler-based unit tests using the 64spec framework.

Version:: 3.7 or higher
Installation:: Available at https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/
Environment:: Must be available on system `PATH` as `x64sc` or `x64` command

==== Exomizer

A file cruncher/packer that can be integrated into build pipelines.

Version:: Latest stable recommended
Installation:: Available at https://github.com/Kroc/exomizer
Usage:: Used with `commandStep` in Pipeline DSL or custom build scripts

==== GoatTracker 2

Music editor and SID file generator for Commodore 64 sound compositions.

Version:: 2.x (latest recommended)
Installation:: Available at https://www.jammer2000.co.uk/goat/
Environment:: `gt2reloc` command must be available on system `PATH`
Dependencies:: Required for GoatTracker processor (both traditional preprocessor and Pipeline DSL)
Features::
* Convert Goat Tracker SNG format to SID format
* Support for SFX, buffered writes, and various optimizations
* Embeddable in assembly programs

[NOTE]
====
GoatTracker processor support is experimental in version 1.8.0.
The syntax and behavior may change in future releases.
====

== Resource Processors

These processors are intended for asset management and transformation.

=== Charpad Converter

Converts CharPad project files (CTM format) into binary and assembly outputs:

* charset data (character definitions),
* charset attributes, colours, and screen colours,
* tile sets and tile-related data,
* maps and map sections,
* CTM file metadata in assembly format.

Supported CTM Versions:: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

=== Spritepad Converter

Converts SpritePad project files (SPD format) into sprite binary data:

* sprite definitions (up to 64 bytes per sprite),
* sprite attributes.

Supported SPD Versions:: 4, 5

[NOTE]
====
Animation and color export are not currently supported.
====

=== GoatTracker Converter

[WARNING]
====
Experimental feature in version 1.8.0.
====

Converts GoatTracker SNG music files into embeddable SID format:

* SID music data with configurable optimizations,
* optional sound effects support,
* optional zero page buffering for enhanced quality.

=== Image Converter

Processes standard image formats (PNG, etc.) into binary data suitable for C64 programs.

=== Generic Processors

These processors can be used at any stage of the build process.

==== Cruncher/Packer

Data compression processors such as Exomizer that reduce program size.

== CI/CD Requirements

For continuous integration environments (CircleCI, TravisCI), additional tools may be available:

=== CircleCI

The official Docker image `maciejmalecki/c64libci:0.1.7` includes:

* Java 11+
* Gradle
* KickAssembler
* VICE 3.x
* GoatTracker 2
* Exomizer

No additional setup required when using this image.
