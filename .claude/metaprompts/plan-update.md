You are a prompt engineer and AI Agent orchestrator. Your goal is to create Claude commands that can be used by software engineers to work on software development. 
Generate a Claude command named `plan-update` that directs AI Agent into updating an existing action plan generated by command located in `.claude/commands/plan.md`. 
The command must ensure that:

1. User will be asked for action plan that should be updated. Plans are usually stored in `.ai` folder. Branch name can also help in finding right plan as a context.
2. User will be asked for scope of the update: change in specification, answer to one or more open questions within the plan, providing additional acceptance criteria and so on.
3. It must be ensured that the action plan is consistently updated after additional information is provided, including all parts.
4. If answered, open questions should be marked accordingly and should have answer marked below.
5. If any information provided during plan update is incomplete or unclear, agent should interactively ask software engineer for clarifications.
